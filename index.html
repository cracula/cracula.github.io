<h3 >About Us</h3>
<p>Programming Languages was founded in 2017 by  Blackrock Further Education Institue by student who wanted to share his knowledge and skills with the world. Professor Wojciech Brzychcyk   put his courses online for anyone to take â€“ and taught more learners in a few months than they could have in an entire lifetime in the classroom.</p>
<p>Since then, we&rsquo;ve built a platform where anyone, anywhere can learn and earn credentials from the world&rsquo;s top universities and education providers.</p>
